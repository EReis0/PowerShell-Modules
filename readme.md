# PowerShell Samples

I haven't shared any PowerShell samples on GitHub before, but there is no better time to start than the present. 
The scripts, custom modules, or knowledge that is safe to share will be posted here.

Keep in mind that I am 100% self-taught so the way I do things might be a little different from what you're used to. 
I do welcome feedback or suggestions that would help to improve my craft. My goal is to get goooood, so I can assist other projects on GitHub.

Development has always been a passion for me and when I am coding, I am in my happy place :)
