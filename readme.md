# Introduction

I haven't shared any PowerShell samples on GitHub before, but there is no better time to start than the present. 

I tend to explore a lot and tinker with anything that peeks my interest. 
Each adventure I have written scripts, reusable functions, and created tons of documentation. This is my attempt to package those souvenirs and share them with you. 

Keep in mind that I am 100% self-taught so the way I do things might be a little different from what you're used to. 
I do welcome feedback or suggestions that would help to improve my craft. My goal is to get goooood, so I can assist other projects on GitHub.

Development has always been a passion of mine and when I am coding, I am in my happy place :)
